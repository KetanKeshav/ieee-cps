			<h2>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)</h2>
            <p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation, networking, and physical processes.  In cyber-physical systems, computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. In CPS the  physical and software components are deeply intertwined, able to operate on different spatial and temporal scales, exhibit multiple and distinct behavioral modalities, and interact with each other in ways that change with context.  CPS has the ability to support complex behaviours of systems and networks. CPS can practically solve and handle real-time problems which are difficult to predict and overcome. The safety and reliability of these systems are very critical. Exploiting the opportunities made possible by CPS requires overcoming a number of challenges, protect as well as strengthen its resilience against natural disasters and inadvertent threats.</p>
            <h2>About the symposium</h2>
            <p>This one day symposium will cover some of the key requirements, challenges, advances and opportunities in Cyber physical systems security including communication, computing and control. It provides a platform for researchers to find problems and avenues for grants.</p>
            <p>To harness the potential of this new wave of technology and make India a leading player in CPS, the Union Cabinet approved the launch of National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems (NM-ICPS) to be implemented by the Department of Science & Technology (DST) with a total outlay of Rs. 3660 Crore for a period of five years. The Mission aims to create a strong foundation and a seamless ecosystem for CPS technologies by coordinating and integrating nationwide efforts encompassing knowledge generation, human resource development, research, technology and product development, innovation and commercialization. 
              Since CPS systems involve both physical objects and computer networks, the safety and reliability of these systems become more critical and this symposium focuses on these aspects. </p><p> Development of Threat models for CPS, Physical layer security for CPS, Security on heterogeneous CPS, Secure protocol design in CPS and Vulnerability analysis of CPS are important. In addition to the cyber security, the safety of CPS should address not only the functional safety but also the physical safety. The symposium will cover the various security challenges for smart grids and health sector in the context of CPSs. This symposium would help students and researchers to understand the current research trends in CPS safety and security in the area of energy and health.</p>
